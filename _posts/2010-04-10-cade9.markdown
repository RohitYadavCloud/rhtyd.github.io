title: "CADE9"

CADE9 is my small embedded project consisting of ATmega32 microcontroller with custom hardware which I hand soldered on a matrix board. It uses the open source [cocoOS](http://www.cocoos.net) as scheduler. On top of CADE9 one can implement classic arcade games like snakes, pong, bricks, breakout etc. (arCADE games with max. displayable score limit of 9, so CADE9 :)

Hardware Specs:

- ATmega32 uC @ 16MHz
- 12 x 7 custom hand soldered (3mm) LED matrix
- Two 7-segment displays to display scores.
- Five buttons for input: Up, Down, Left, Right and Fire.
- One buzzer for audio effects.

In the video below, I play a game of 1-player pong; the left bat is the computer and top 7-segment display shows score of the computer. The player with a score of 9 dot wins! Because I did not use any good locking mechanism, it sometimes misses a good hit. The code is pretty naive.
