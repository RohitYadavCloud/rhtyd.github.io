excerpt: Eight week internship at CERN

During the last 8 weeks I worked as a volunteer summer student at [CERN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN) with my awesome mentor/supervisor [Dr. Ben Segal][ben] and the [CernVM][] team. I continued work of past CERN summer students on [BOINCVM][boincvm] (volunteer cloud computing platform for scientific research based on BOINC infrastructure) by improving code, fixing bugs and testing on Linux, Mac and Windows, using the [CernVM][] virtual software appliance. I also improved server side configuration and administration of a test [BOINCVM][boincvm] project.

Work aside, I met some amazing people during my time at CERN. Above is a photograph of the office which I shared with 5 other facinating people for sometime before I shifted to another office. My schedule was tight (I had my GSoC too), but I cruised through both of them; my secret was this chart:

Experimental physicist [Dr. Archana Sharma][archana] helped all of us, the *desi* student crowd at CERN (thanks a lot ma'am!). Below is a photographic panaroma of Dr. [Sharma][archana]'s house where about 10s of students and few scientists had a *desi* get-together:

My mentor, Dr. Ben Segal arranged a tour of CERN Computer Centre for us (thanks a lot sir for making that possible!). Below is a photographic panaroma of the server farm;

I was so thrilled to stand next to the _NEXT_ computer that ran the world's first web server, which was written and managed by Sir Tim Berners Lee himself.
