excerpt: My super duper android powered Rover
---

A premature mock-up of my anticipated masters project, *R2A2* (credit to my big bro for the name), thanks to Avinash bhaiya and Gaurav bhaiya for ordering/getting me some of its important parts which includes; the gas sensors, IOIO (Android USB interpretor), Rover5 platform and the robotic claw. No promises but I hope to complete a working prototype of my super duper android powered rover soon before 2011 ends :)
