[**SFD**](http://softwarefreedomday.org) '11 @ IT-BHU went well, explore some photos [here](https://picasaweb.google.com/rohityadav89/SoftwareFreedomDay2011). Software Freedom Day (SFD) is an annual worldwide celebration of Free Software. SFD is a public education effort with the aim of increasing awareness of Free Software and its virtues, and encouraging its use.

Many thanks to *Tabrez* and all the students who attended the event. Hope they will continue to use Linux and open source applications for the rest of their lives. A gist of what went, for your reference:

* Brief history of UNIX, FSF/GNU and Linux, why Linux?
* Distribution of Ubuntu CDs, Goodies
* Students tried to partition/Install/Try-Ubuntu
* People inclined towards Windows, tried Ubuntu on VirtualBox
* Tour of Gnome and some basic [commands](http://linuxcommand.org/learning_the_shell.php).
* How to [install software](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Howto) on Debian/Ubuntu based Linux distros.
* Where to get started with GUI based Linux application development using C/[Gtk+](http://www.zetcode.com/tutorials/gtktutorial/ ) or C++/[Qt4](http://www.zetcode.com/tutorials/qt4tutorial/).
