excerpt: Why I almost rm -fr ~/fb/
---

Around four months back, I decided to call it quits on almost all my social networks and posted a message on August the 6th. It's interesting to note that not all of these networks provide an option to delete one's profile. I decided to deactivate my fb, I certainly did not want to delete the account and lose all my contacts.

Soon enough I had more time to kill, I missed all those posts, flame-wars, pics... During that period, I would read a lot and Internet meant a place to check mail, browse top stories on HN, Google News and slashdot. And soon, we had Google+ to play with. Amidst the war of the social networks, I reactivated my facebook account in early December, got myself a new twitter account to keep up with friends and family members. I hope to mostly use my homepage and blog to share stuff. And now I realize again, I'm wasting my time on them. It's a loop :P

So, who wins? People want to be on facebook because their friends are on facebook, that's exactly what happened when majority of us shifted from Orkut to Facebook. Majority of my friends are yet to move on to G+ and those who are there are yet to make G+ their defacto network. Let's see who wins. What's in 2012, we'll find that next year, around this time if we survive ;)
