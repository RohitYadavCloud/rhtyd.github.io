And after a fun Sunday evening with python and opencv I hacked up a prank, `baagichhaap` that takes in a photo, tries to detect a face (red squares), a nose (blue squares) and a mouth (green squares) and based on the obtained information it draws a _mustache_ on it.

It even works with big images with large number of people in it, with some errors due to opencv. The above Baagichhaap'd photograph is of our CS batch at IIT, some of the folks in it really look like they own their _moochh-es_.
