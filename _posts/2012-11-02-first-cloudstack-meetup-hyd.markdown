We had our first official [Apache CloudStack](http://incubator.apache.org/cloudstack) [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/CloudStack-Hyderabad-Group/events/86658162/) in Hyderabad yesterday, 1 Nov 2012, at Lemon Tree, Hyderabad. Earlier we gave a small bird eye view [presentation](http://people.apache.org/~bhaisaab/meetups/sep-2012) on Apache CloudStack during a local Hadoop User Group (HUG) [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/hyderabad-hadoop/events/81746952/). This time, the meetup was totally focussed on Apache CloudStack.

The meetup started at 5PM and the presentations ended at 7:20PM, followed by about an hour of networking and discussions, and t-shirts for everyone. It was attended by 134 people and organised by 7 people that includes (Nitin who was out of station at the time), Kishan, Prasanna, Bidisha, Sadhu, Praveen, Hari P and myself.

We started by welcoming the attendees and showed them an introductory video on Apache CloudStack. Next we did a poll and found that all of the attendees have heard of cloud computing, most of them use or are going to use cloud or are excited to learn about it. Most of the crowd rated themselves as users, some managers and some engineers. Most of them said they use open source technologies on daily basis and there were few who contribute to opensource.
