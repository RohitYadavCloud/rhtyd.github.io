[Namaste][]! I'm Rohit Yadav ([Devanāgarī][devnagari]: रोहित यादव). I earned my
B.Tech and M.Tech (IDD) in computer science and engineering from
[IIT-BHU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology_%28Banaras_Hindu_University%29_Varanasi).
I'm an opensource and free software evangelist and in my free time I read [HN][]
&amp; [Slashdot][]; hangout with my [gang](http://baagi.org); sometimes I like
to beatbox and play bansuri/xaphoon/tin-whistle/flute; learn new things, hack;
I love gadgets, electronics, robots and work on some opensource projects.

These days I'm an [Apache CloudStack](http://incubator.apache.org/cloudstack/)
developer and [committer](https://www.ohloh.net/p/CloudStack/contributors/).
During the journey of hacking CloudStack I authored
[cloudmonkey](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/cloudmonkey), created a newer
[DevCloud2](http://people.apache.org/~bhaisaab/cloudstack/devcloud/devcloud2.ova),
refactored the api layer and related services, wrote few plugins, worked on
virtual router, developed scripts for creating custom or DIY SystemVM templates,
developed DatabaseCreator for rolling db upgrades, worked on a lot of bugs and
maven build system issues. I also helped arrange a meetup, spoke at a
[conference](http://collab12.cloudstack.org/), participated in the 4.0, 4.0.1
release process. I'm personally looking forward to the 4.1 and 4.2 releases, and
ACS becoming a top level project.

As one of the [VLMC][] developers, I worked on its GNU/Linux and Mac OS ports
and maintain its CMake based [build system][CMakeQt] that I mostly wrote myself.

On IRC I'm *bhaisaab* and I hangout on #vlmc, #videolan, #baagi, #cloudstack, #cloudstack-dev
and #cloudstack-meeting. In my free time, I'm developing a (teaching/hobby/x86)
monolithic kernel; hacking Arduinos and RaspbeeryPis; and fooling around with
[functional](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) programming languages.

Graffiti was the most creative and fun project which my friend [Abhishek][] and
I hacked from scratch during our sophomore year at [IIT-BHU][]. My B.Tech
project, [VMController], was based on the [works][david-boincvm] of the amazing
[David Garcia Quintas][david] and was a motivation to work on CloudStack.
My M.Tech dissertation was on wireless speech
controlled mobile robot with collision free path planning. During my last year
at IIT-BHU, my friends and I found an unused 1Gbps NKN (National Knowledge
Network) fibre-optics based Internet link and about 196 multicore servers
(donated by NVidia), and we used some of those servers to create a VPN server
that serves over 3000 students and was a lot better than the BHU-CC proxies.

In the past I was; [GSoC] student for [VideoLAN][yt-vlmc-wiki] and my
[project][gsoc-project] was around [VLMC][]; [Unpaid Associate][boincvm] at CERN
and I worked with the awesome [Dr. Ben Segal][ben] and the [CernVM][] team and
contributed to the [BOINCVM][boincvm] project; and Adobe AIR app dev contest
grand prize winner at the [TechFest][] (AIR-O-MANIA) and the [CodeFest][] (Gumbo
Rumble), for [ScuttleButt][].

My areas of interest include (but are not limited to) operating systems, cloud
computing, compilers, functional programming languages, virtualization and
hypervisors, embedded systems and _robotics_.

I find most social networks boring and frivolous, but irc/twitter works. I think
mutt is one of the best software ever written and so are GNU/Linux, zsh, tmux and
irssi; email still rocks and is the best way to reach me - <bhaisaab@baagi.org>
