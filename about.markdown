[Namaste][]! I'm Rohit Yadav ([Devanāgarī][devnagari]: रोहित यादव). I earned my
B.Tech and M.Tech (IDD) in computer science and engineering from
[IIT-BHU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology_%28Banaras_Hindu_University%29_Varanasi).
I'm an opensource and free software evangelist and in my free time I read [HN][]
&amp; [Slashdot][]; hangout with my [gang](http://baagi.org); sometimes I like
to beatbox and play bansuri/xaphoon/tin-whistle/flute; learn new things, hack;
I love gadgets, electronics, robots and work on some opensource projects.

My current hacking gig is at a New Delhi based startup, [Wingify](http://wingify.com).

I'm one of the [Apache CloudStack](http://cloudstack.apache.org/)
[committers](https://www.ohloh.net/p/CloudStack/contributors/).
Contributing to CloudStack is a hobby now which used to be full time job once
sponsored by my previous employer Citrix. During the journey of hacking CloudStack I authored
[cloudmonkey](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/cloudmonkey), created a newer
[DevCloud2](http://people.apache.org/~bhaisaab/cloudstack/devcloud/devcloud2.ova),
refactored the api layer and related services, wrote few plugins, worked on
virtual router, developed scripts for creating custom or DIY SystemVM templates,
developed DatabaseCreator for rolling db upgrades, worked on a lot of bugs and
maven build system issues. I also helped arrange a meetup, spoke at a
[conference](http://collab12.cloudstack.org/), participated in the 4.0, 4.0.1, 4.1,
and 4.2 release processes, and I got to see ACS become a top level project.

I used to contribute to [VLMC][] project which sadly is not active anymore. I
worked on its GNU/Linux and Mac OS ports, and maintained its CMake based [build
system][CMakeQt] that I mostly wrote myself. I also contributed to vlc-android fork
initially and wrote the JNI for playback functions and some garbage collection for it.
If you've an Android phone, install VLC because you deserve to find me in the author credits :P

On IRC, as *bhaisaab* I sometimes hangout on #vlmc, #videolan, #baagi, #cloudstack, #cloudstack-dev
and #cloudstack-meeting. In my free time, I'm developing a (teaching/hobby/x86)
monolithic kernel and fooling around with different
[functional](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) programming languages.

During my college days, I hacked up Graffiti with my friend [Abhishek][] at [IIT-BHU][]
which was creative and fun project. My B.Tech project, [VMController],
was based on the [works][david-boincvm] of the amazing [David Garcia Quintas][david]
who's a Googler now and it motivated me to explore clouds and eventually work on
CloudStack. My M.Tech dissertation was on wireless speech controlled mobile
robot with collision free path planning which got me awesome grages, but was a complete waste.
During my last year at IIT, my friend _pk_ and I found an unused 1Gbps NKN (National Knowledge
Network) fibre-optics based Internet link and about 196 multicore servers
(donated by NVidia), and we used some of those servers to create a VPN server
that serves over 3000 students and was a lot better than the BHU-CC proxies.

Also in the past I was; [GSoC] student for [VideoLAN][yt-vlmc-wiki] and my
[project][gsoc-project] was around [VLMC][]; [Unpaid Associate][boincvm] at CERN
and I worked with the awesome [Dr. Ben Segal][ben] and the [CernVM][] team and
contributed to the [BOINCVM][boincvm] project; and Adobe AIR app dev contest
grand prize winner at the [TechFest][] (AIR-O-MANIA) and the [CodeFest][] (Gumbo
Rumble), for [ScuttleButt][].

My areas of interest include (but are not limited to) operating systems, cloud
computing, compilers, distributed systems, infra and scalability, functional
programming languages, virtualization and hypervisors.

I find most social networks boring and frivolous, but irc/twitter works. I think
mutt is one of the best software ever written and so are GNU/Linux, zsh, tmux and
irssi; email still rocks and is the best way to reach me - <bhaisaab@baagi.org>
