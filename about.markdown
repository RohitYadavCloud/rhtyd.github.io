[Namaste](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namaste)! I'm Rohit Yadav, founder of
[ScaleNinja](http://www.scaleninja.com) and a software architect at
[ShapeBlue](http://shapeblue.com).

I'm an [active
committer](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/graphs/contributors) and a PMC
member of the [Apache CloudStack](http://cloudstack.apache.org) project.  I'm
also the author and primary maintainer of Apache CloudStack
[CloudMonkey](http://github.com/apache/cloudstack-cloudmonkey). Help yourself
with my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/bhaisaab),
[Github](https://github.com/bhaisaab) and
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/_bhaisaab). For consulting and short-term
assignments, [drop a line](mailto:rohit@scaleninja.com).

I started as a hobbyist contributing to few opensource projects such as
[VLC/VLC-android](http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc-ports/android.git;a=search;h=HEAD;s=Rohit+Yadav;st=author),
[VLMC](http://trac.videolan.org/vlmc) and a
[few](http://cgit.haiku-os.org/haiku/commit/?id=hrev39379)
[patches](http://cgit.haiku-os.org/haiku/commit/?id=hrev39378) to HaikuOS; but
now that I'm professionally working on opensource full-time, most of my
hobbies now exist in the physical world such as playing [bansuri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bansuri),
beatboxing, swimming and working out in the gym.
