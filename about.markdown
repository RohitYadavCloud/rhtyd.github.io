Hi, I'm Rohit Yadav, currently a Software Architect at [ShapeBlue](http://shapeblue.com).
I'm also one of the committers of [Apache CloudStack](http://cloudstack.apache.org)
since 2012. I graduated from [IIT-BHU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology_%28Banaras_Hindu_University%29_Varanasi)
with degrees of [B.Tech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Technology) and
[M.Tech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Engineering) in computer science
and engineering in 2012.

Previously, I've worked at [Wingify](http://wingify.com), [Citrix](http://citrix.com),
[CERN](http://ph-dep-sft.web.cern.ch) and was a Google Summer of Code 2010 student for
[VideoLAN](http://videolan.org). I love opensource and have contributed to
opensource projects such as VLC-android, veewee, VLMC, BOINCVM, HaikuOS in the
past. I'm a proud EFF member and supporter of freedom of speech, free press, net
neutrality, the Free Software Foundation and the Wikimedia Foundation.

My areas of interest include (but are not limited to) cloud computing, distributed
systems, fault-tolerant systems, infrastructure scalability, virtualization, hypervisors,
file systems, job schedulers, programming languages, operating systems and compilers.

I also do contract/consultancy work and short term remote assignments.
