[Namaste][]! I'm Rohit Yadav ([Devanāgarī][devnagari]: रोहित यादव), currently a IDD/M.Tech (computer science and engineering) student at [IIT-BHU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology_%28Banaras_Hindu_University%29_Varanasi). I'm an opensource and free software evangelist and in my free time I read [HN][] &amp; [Slashdot][]; hangout with my [gang](http://baagi.org); sometimes I like to beatbox and play bansuri/flute; learn new things; and work on some opensource projects.

As one of the [VLMC][] developers, I work on the GNU/Linux and the Mac OS ports and maintain its CMake based [build system][CMakeQt] that I mostly wrote myself. On Freenode, I'm *bhaisaab* and can be found on #vlmc, #baagi. Graffiti was the most creative and fun project which my friend [Abhishek][] and I hacked from scratch during our sophomore year at [IIT-BHU][]. My B.Tech project, [VMController], was based on the [works][david-boincvm] of the amazing [David Garcia Quintas][david].

These days I'm writing my M.Tech dissertation on wireless speech controlled mobile robot; volunteering my engineering skills at [WMG-ITBHU](http://14.139.228.210/vpn/); developing a (teaching/hobby/x86) monolithic kernel; hacking Arduinos; and fooling around with [functional](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) programming languages.

In the past I was; [GSoC] student for [VideoLAN][yt-vlmc-wiki] and my [project][gsoc-project] was around [VLMC][]; [Unpaid Associate][boincvm] at CERN and I worked with the awesome [Dr. Ben Segal][ben] and the [CernVM][] team and contributed to the [BOINCVM][boincvm] project; and Adobe AIR app dev contest grand prize winner at the [TechFest][] (AIR-O-MANIA) and the [CodeFest][] (Gumbo Rumble), for [ScuttleButt][]. My areas of interest include (but are not limited to) operating systems, compilers, functional languages, virtualization and hypervisors, embedded systems and robotics.

I find most social networks boring and frivolous, I don't have a facebook account but irc/twitter works. I think mutt is one of the best software ever written and so are GNU/Linux, gcc, vim and irssi; email is awesome and the best way to reach me - <rohityadav89@gmail.com>
