[Namaste](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namaste)!

I'm Rohit Yadav, founder of [ScaleNinja](http://www.scaleninja.com) and software
architect working with [ShapeBlue](http://shapeblue.com). I'm an [active
committer](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/graphs/contributors) and PMC
member of the [Apache CloudStack](http://cloudstack.apache.org) project. I'm
also the author and maintainer of
Apache CloudStack [CloudMonkey](http://github.com/apache/cloudstack-cloudmonkey).
I graduated from [IIT-BHU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology_%28Banaras_Hindu_University%29_Varanasi)
with degrees of [B.Tech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Technology) and
[M.Tech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Engineering) in computer science
and engineering in 2012. Checkout my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/bhaisaab)
profile for more details. I also do
[contract/consultancy](mailto:rohit@scaleninja.com) work and short term remote
assignments. [GPG](/gpg.pub) | [Keybase](https://keybase.io/bhaisaab) |
[SSH](/ssh.pub) | [EMAIL](mailto:rohit@scaleninja.com).

I'm a passionate opensource contributor and in the past I've contributed to VLC,
VLC-android, VLMC, BOINC-VM, HaikuOS and have opensourced many of my [personal
projects](https://github.com/bhaisaab?tab=repositories).
I consider myself a pragmatic programmer, a touch typist and I love mechanical
keyboards. I like to use and promote opensource software, I'm personally a big
fan and user of various GNU/Linux distros (Fedora, Ubuntu, CentOS), vim, git, tmux,
CloudStack, irssi, zsh, mutt, clisp, Go, Python/ipython and Firefox. My hobbies
include playing flute/bansuri/sax, exploring nature, toying with different
programming languages, beatboxing, swimming and working out in gym.

So far in my life I've met amazing individuals and do-ers who I either know closely or I've worked with them.
They all have inspired me and continue to inspire and amaze me. The list is big but
