opensource [Apache CloudStack](http://cloudstack.apache.org) project and also known as creator of [CloudMonkey](http://github.com/apache/cloudstack-cloudmonkey).
I graduated from [IIT-BHU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology_%28Banaras_Hindu_University%29_Varanasi)
with degrees of [B.Tech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Technology) and

and engineering in 2012. Refer my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/bhaisaab) profile for more details. I also do [contract/consultancy](mailto:rohit@scaleninja.com) work and short term remote assignments.
