Hi, I'm Rohit Yadav, a software architect at [ShapeBlue](http://shapeblue.com),
founder of [ScaleNinja](http://www.scaleninja.com) and an active committer of
opensource [Apache CloudStack](http://cloudstack.apache.org) project.
I graduated from [IIT-BHU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology_%28Banaras_Hindu_University%29_Varanasi)
with degrees of [B.Tech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Technology) and

opensource projects such as VLC-android, veewee, VLMC, BOINCVM, HaikuOS in the
past. I'm a proud EFF member and supporter of freedom of speech, free press, net
