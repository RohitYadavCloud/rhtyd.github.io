[Namaste][]! I'm Rohit Yadav ([Devanāgarī][devnagari]: रोहित यादव), one of the 11 computer science and engineering masters' student at <strike>[IT-BHU][]</strike> [IIT-BHU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Technology,_Banaras_Hindu_University#Conversion_into_an_Indian_Institute_of_Technology). I'm a GNU/Linux evangelist who believes in freedom, sharing and helping people; and in my free time, I like to geekout, read [HN][] &amp; [Slashdot][], play bansuri/flute/guitar, learn new things and sometimes hack open source projects. As one of the [VLMC][] developers, I work on its Linux and Mac OS ports and maintain its CMake based [build system][CMakeQt] that I mostly wrote myself. On Freenode, I'm *rohityadav* and can be found on #vlmc, #videolan. Graffiti is the most creative and fun project which my friend [Abhishek][] and I created from scratch during our sophomore year at [IT-BHU][]. My B.Tech project, [VMController], was based on the [works][david-boincvm] of the amazing [David Garcia Quintas][david]. These days I'm working on my M.Tech *dissertation* in the area of speech controlled mobile robots; volunteering at [WMG-ITBHU](http://14.139.228.210/vpn/); hacking ATmega microcontrollers and Androids; and developing mysterious projects with my friend [pk][] for his [startup][innogrids].

In the past I was; [GSoC] student for [VideoLAN][yt-vlmc-wiki] and my [project][gsoc-project] was around [VLMC][]; [Unpaid Associate][boincvm] at CERN and I worked with the awesome [Dr. Ben Segal][ben] and the [CernVM][] team and contributed to the [BOINCVM][boincvm] project; and Adobe AIR app dev contest grand prize winner at the [TechFest][] (AIR-O-MANIA) and the [CodeFest][] (Gumbo Rumble), for [ScuttleButt][]. My areas of interest include (but are not limited to) operating systems, virtualization and hypervisors, embedded systems, algorithms and robotics.

I find social networks boring and frivolous, I think email is awesome that lets you communicate asynchronously; the fastest way to reach me - <rohityadav89@gmail.com>
