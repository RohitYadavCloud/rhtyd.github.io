[Namaste](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namaste)! I'm Rohit Yadav, VP of
[Apache CloudStack](http://cloudstack.apache.org) and VP Engineering at [ShapeBlue](https://www.shapeblue.com/shapeblue-leadership-team/).

I'm a long-time [PMC member](http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html#rohit)
and [committer](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/graphs/contributors) of the
<span class="logo acs">&nbsp;</span> [Apache CloudStack](http://cloudstack.apache.org)
project, an open source Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing platform.

I've served as the [release
manager](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/releases) for several CloudStack releases,
and authored several CloudStack flagship features, frameworks and tools such as
[cmk](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-cloudmonkey),
[mbx](https://github.com/shapeblue/mbx), and the CloudStack
[UI](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/tree/main/ui) (originally started as project
[Primate](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-primate)). I wrote the opensource
CloudStack developer onboarding course [hackerbook](https://github.com/shapeblue/hackerbook)
and I regularly speak at CloudStack and related meetups and conferences. Nowadays,
Iâ€™ve transitioned into a mentoring and leadership role both in the community and at work.

My [GPG key](/gpg.pub) is [0x0EE3D884](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?search=0x5ED1E1122DC5E8A4A45112C2484248210EE3D884&fingerprint=on&op=index), full fingerprint of my key is: `5ED1 E112 2DC5 E8A4 A451 12C2 4842 4821 0EE3 D884`.

My interest and journey in the cloud computing space started at CERN in 2010, where
I got hands-on experience in virtualisation and cloud computing as a volunteer
summer student Dr. [Ben Segal](http://ben.web.cern.ch/ben). Since 2012, I've been
working on Apache CloudStack which has allowed me to work in several areas of interest
such as data-center virtualisation, networking, storage, distributed systems,
resource management and scheduling, infrastructure and devops.
