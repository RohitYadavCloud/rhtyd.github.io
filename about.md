[Namaste](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namaste)! I'm Rohit Yadav, [PMC
member](http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html#rohit)
and one of the top [committers](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/graphs/contributors)
at the <span class="logo acs">&nbsp;</span> [Apache
CloudStack](http://cloudstack.apache.org) project.
Apache CloudStack is an open source software  designed to deploy and manage
large networks of virtual machines, as a highly available, highly scalable
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing platform.

I oversee the software engineering function at
[ShapeBlue](https://www.shapeblue.com) as the Principal Engineer, providing
leadership and mentorship to our ever-growing engineering team.

I've also served as the [release
manager](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/releases) for several
CloudStack releases. I'm the author of [cmk](http://github.com/apache/cloudstack-cloudmonkey),
the modern CloudStack UI (codename [primate](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-primate),
now just the `UI` since v4.15) and several flagship CloudStack features and
frameworks. I also wrote the CloudStack developer onboarding course
[hackerbook](https://github.com/shapeblue/hackerbook) and local CloudStack CI/CD
tool [mbx](https://github.com/shapeblue/mbx).

My [GPG key](/gpg.pub) is [0x0EE3D884](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&fingerprint=on&exact=on&search=0x5ED1E1122DC5E8A4A45112C2484248210EE3D884), full fingerprint of my key is: `5ED1 E112 2DC5 E8A4 A451 12C2 4842 4821 0EE3 D884`.

I'm a vegetarian and an animal lover. I like cats, red pandas, dogs and otters
very much. In my free time, I curate and maintain a cat-care and local
recommendations website - [Happy Kitten](https://happykitten.in), and care for
my cats [Ashley and Gracie](https://www.instagram.com/ashley.and.gracie.cats/).

My journey in cloud computing started at CERN in 2010, where as a volunteer
summer student under Dr. [Ben Segal](http://ben.web.cern.ch/ben) (who
was also a mentor of Sir Tim-Berners Lee) I got hands-on experience in
virtualisation and Python. In the last decade, since 2012, I've been working on
Apache CloudStack where several domains of my interest intersect such as
virtualisation, networking, storage, distributed systems, resource management
and scheduling, infrastructure and devops.
