I'm passionate about <span class="logo acs">&nbsp;</span> Apache CloudStack which has been my interest for more than
half a decade now. I've [contributed](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/commits?author=rhtyd)
several features including their bugs and fixes :wink:; and have been the
maintainer and [release manager](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/tags)
for maintenance releases of CloudStack 4.3, 4.5
and recently 4.9/LTS. I'll be the RM for 4.11/LTS too! Some of the recent notable features I've
authored/co-authored and contributed are â€“ the [CA framework](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Secure+Agent+Communications),
the [host-ha framework](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Host+HA) and
[dynamic roles](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Dynamic+Role+Based+API+Access+Checker+for+CloudStack).
