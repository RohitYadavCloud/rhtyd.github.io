[Namaste](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namaste)! I'm Rohit Yadav, a
[PMC member](http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html#rohit)
and one of the top [committers](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/graphs/contributors)
at the <span class="logo acs">&nbsp;</span> [Apache CloudStack](http://cloudstack.apache.org).
Apache CloudStack is open source software  designed to deploy and manage large
networks of virtual machines, as a highly available, highly scalable
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing platform.

I work at [ShapeBlue](http://shapeblue.com) as a software architect.

I've also served as the [release
manager](https://checker.apache.org/keys/484248210ee3d884) for several
CloudStack releases including the recent 4.11/LTS release and several security
releases. I'm also the author and maintainer of Apache CloudStack
[CloudMonkey](http://github.com/apache/cloudstack-cloudmonkey) :monkey_face:.

My [GPG key](/gpg.pub) is [0x0EE3D884](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&fingerprint=on&exact=on&search=0x5ED1E1122DC5E8A4A45112C2484248210EE3D884), full fingerprint of my key is: `5ED1 E112 2DC5 E8A4 A451 12C2 4842 4821 0EE3 D884`.
I also use this key to sign Apache CloudStack [releases](https://checker.apache.org/keys/484248210ee3d884)
among other artifacts.

I'm an animal lover, like cats, red pandas and dogs. I curate and maintain
[Happy Kitten](https://happykitten.in), and consider myself an amateur cat
behaviourist.

During my univesity days at IIT (2007-2012), I was introduced to Linux by
[Himadri](https://in.linkedin.com/in/himadrisarkar).
[Harshath](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jrharshath/) introduced me
to vim and touch typing. [Abhishek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shwstppr/) and I
worked on several awesome C++/Qt projects such as
[Graffiti](https://github.com/rhtyd/old/tree/master/graffiti).
[Pankaj](https://xtrack.io/) "pk" and I worked on some interesting network stuff
including setting up a campus-wide VPN and played with some of the 200 physical
2U servers. For a brief period, I got into robotics, electronic and even made my
own atmega based [arcade game](/blog/cade9/). I support software freedom and
[Stallman's four freedoms](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html). For
a brief period I worked on VideoLAN's VLC, VLC-android and completed a GSoC
project around VLMC, all of which encouraged me to find a career in and around
opensource.

I also worked as a volunteer summer student at CERN in 2010 under my mentor Dr.
[Ben Segal](http://ben.web.cern.ch/ben/) (also the mentor of Sir Tim-Berners
Lee). I got introduced to virtualization at CERN and started programming in
Python with great guidance from [David Quintas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidgarciaquintas)
whom I consider one of the greatest programmers I've personally worked withâ„¢.
My B.Tech thesis extended David's initial work on [VMController](https://github.com/rhtyd/old/tree/master/vmcontroller)
which was a limited IaaS platform for managing single-virtualbox hosts and had
some design related similarities with CloudStack.

Fast forward now, I've been working on Apache CloudStack for than half a decade
that intersects several domains of my interest such as virtualization,
networking, storage, distributed systems, resource management and scheduling,
infrastructure and devops.
